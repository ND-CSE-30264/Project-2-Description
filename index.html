<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this project, you will need to analyze network traffic traces collected from different applications.</p>

<p>The objective of this project is to understand how real network traffic is structured, understand how to analyze network traffic, as well as understand its characteristics and properties.</p>

<!-- <p>You may use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> to track the progress of your work. There are several resources that provide further information about <a href="https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners">git</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop">GitHub</a>. -->

<p class="alert alert-danger">You are encouraged to use Wireshark as well as Python and other programming languages to inspect and analyze the provided network traffic traces.</p>

<h2 id="task-description">Network Traffic Traces</h2>

<p>You are given four network traffic traces (trace 1, trace 2, trace 3, and trace 4). Each trace contains the network traffic generated by a different application. Applications are kept secret for the time being. It will be part of your project to look through the traces and find clues that will help you identify each application. All traces contain information about all layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack (link layer all the way up to the application layer). You can find the traffic traces <a href="https://github.com/ND-CSE-30264/Project-2-Traces">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="server-application-specification">Trace 1</h3>

<p>Use Wireshark to open <a href="https://github.com/ND-CSE-30264/Project-2-Traces/blob/main/trace-1.pcapng">trace 1</a>. This trace contains about 30 seconds of traffic. Feel free to inspect traffic through Wireshark or export the traffic as .csv files (or files of other formats) and use scripts to analyze it. For this trace, let's think through and answer the questions below.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Q1: What is the application that generated the traffic in this trace? How did you come up with this answer? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q2: What are the two IP addresses used in the context of this application? Are they public or private IP addresses? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q3: Let's call the two IP addresses used IP1 and IP2. How many packets and bytes of traffic were sent from IP1 to IP2 and from IP2 back to IP1? How did you come up with your answer? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <!-- <li>
    <p>The server should be able to accept and process multiple connection from clients at the same time</p>
  </li> -->
  <li>
    <p>Q4: Are there any losses experienced during the operation of this application? If so, how many and why they might have happened? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q5: Considering the answer that you gave for Q1, what information was exchanged between the two IP addresses? (5 pts)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="client-application-specification">Trace 2</h3>

<p>Use Wireshark to open <a href="https://github.com/ND-CSE-30264/Project-2-Traces/blob/main/trace-2.pcapng">trace 2</a>. This trace contains about 50 seconds of traffic. Feel free to inspect traffic through Wireshark or export the traffic as .csv files (or files of other formats) and use scripts to analyze it. For this trace, let's think through and answer the questions below.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Q1: What is the application that generated the traffic in this trace? How did you come up with this answer? (5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q2: What are the two IP addresses used in the context of this application? Are they public or private IP addresses? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q3: Let's call the two IP addresses used IP1 and IP2. How many packets and bytes of traffic were sent from IP1 to IP2 and from IP2 back to IP1? How did you come up with your answer? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q4: Is there any relationship between this trace and trace 1? If so, please explain what the relationship is. If not, please explain why not. (5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q5: Can we tell what information was exchanged between the two IP addresses? If yes, please describe what this information is. If not, please explain why not. (5 pts)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="client-application-specification">Trace 3</h3>

<p>Use Wireshark to open <a href="https://github.com/ND-CSE-30264/Project-2-Traces/blob/main/trace-3.pcapng">trace 3</a>. This trace contains about 261 seconds of traffic. Feel free to inspect traffic through Wireshark or export the traffic as .csv files (or files of other formats) and use scripts to analyze it. For this trace, let's think through and answer the questions below.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Q1: What is the application that generated the traffic in this trace? How did you come up with this answer? (10 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q2: What are the IP addresses used in the context of this application? Are they public or private IP addresses? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q3: How many packets and bytes of traffic were sent between the IP addresses included in the trace? How did you come up with your answer? (2.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q4: How many different transport layer protocols are used in this trace? Which are these protocols and what purposes are they used for in the context of this trace? (7.5 pts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q5: Inspect and analyze the packets (or bits) per second rate of this trace and of traces 1 and 2. What differences and/or similarities do you see? Why these differences and/or similarities exist? (10 pts)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="client-application-specification">Trace 4</h3>

<p>Use Wireshark to open <a href="https://github.com/ND-CSE-30264/Project-2-Traces/blob/main/trace-4.pcapng">trace 4</a>. This trace contains about 7 minutes of traffic. Feel free to inspect traffic through Wireshark or export the traffic as .csv files (or files of other formats) and use scripts to analyze it. For this trace, let's think through and answer the questions below.</p>
